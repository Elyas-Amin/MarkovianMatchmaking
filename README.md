# MarkovianMatchmaking

We aim to develop a matchmaking algorithm for an online dating platform that optimizes users' dating experience by learning their preferences and presenting them with the most compatible profiles. We will develop two different algorithms, employing Markov Decision Processes (MDP), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), and evaluate their performance by simulating a user’s decision to accept and reject profiles chosen by our algorithms. One algorithm will use RL to learn user’s preferences, while the second algorithm will apply constraints on the search space and find an optimal cluster of profiles to present to the user. Our goal is to maximize satisfaction by choosing profiles that will result in an acceptance by the user. Our dataset of profiles will be generated using interest tags and demographic information. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms, we will compare the rates of acceptance for a finite horizon simulation.
